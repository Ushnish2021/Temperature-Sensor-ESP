# Temperature-Sensor-ESP
This project demonstrates how to build a simple temperature sensor using an ESP8266/ESP32 microcontroller and a DHT temperature sensor. The ESP microcontroller reads temperature data from the DS18B20 sensor and sends it to a cloud platform for remote monitoring.

#Usage
1. Power up your ESP microcontroller.

2. The ESP will connect to your Wi-Fi network and start reading temperature data from the DS18B20 sensor.

3. The temperature data will be sent to your chosen cloud platform for visualization and monitoring.

4. Access the cloud platform dashboard to view the temperature data remotely.
